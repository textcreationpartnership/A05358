            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is impoſſible that they, whiche were once lightened, and haue taſted of the heauenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and haue taſted of the good worde of God, and of the powers of the world to come. If they fall away ſhould be renewed agayne by repentance: ſeyng they crucifie agayne to them ſelues the ſonne of God, and make a mocke of him.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is ſome space of time expired ſince, that I purpoſed to write ſome litle treatiſe of Apoſtaſie, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the ſlaughter committed on Saint Bartholomewe his day, in the which there chaunced a moſt horrible &amp; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reuolting in all our Churches, ſo that of three partes two of them at the leaſt ſlipped backe, of thoſe which in the beginning entered into it with ſo great readineſſe and courage, that it ſeemed they would continually abide in it, without a mind euer to departe, whatſoeuer temptation ſhoulde offer it ſelfe vnto them. Neuertheleſſe I had hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the ſame hoping that the feare being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, which as a ſtorme and vehement wind, had carried them away from the ſheepefold, and hauing had leiſure to ſettle themſelues and gather their wits together, they might either of themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, or elſe be eaſily called backe againe by the voice of their paſtors. But perceiui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that the moſt part of the Apoſtates, do not only ſlumber &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelues in their ſins: but alſo become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God, and blaspeme without ſhame his
<pb facs="tcp:7280:6"/>word and the true religion, and not content with this, ſtriue by all meanes to withdrawe thoſe from the houſe of God which continued ſtedfaſt in his ſeruice, and to hinder thoſe that deſire to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it againe. I deemed it not meete to diſſemble any longer, but to be neceſſary to put in execution the charge which God hath giuen his ſeruants whom he hath placed in the Church, not onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce remiſſion of ſinnes, to all thoſe who by a liuely faith vvill lay hold of it through the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Ghoſpell: but alſo the vvithholding of the ſame, from all thoſe, vvho vvith an hard and obſtinate heart, do ſtillre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which muſt not ſeeme ſtrange, ſeeing the Ministers of the Ghoſpell be not onely ordained to vnlooſe &amp; abſolue thoſe that beleeue, but alſo to binde and condemne thoſe that remaine obstinate in their infidelitie. For vvhich cauſe God ſeeing the ſtubbornnes and hardnes of the Ievves, doth ſend vnto them his Prophet Eſay, to blind and harden them yet more.

Nowe all theſe aforeſayd, had for a time left God, and were worthye through their ingratitude and diſloyaltie, to haue bene vtterly reiected of him, but he did not execute the rigour of his iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them,

<pb facs="tcp:7280:17"/>els but a fearefull looking for of iudgement, and violent fire which ſhal deuoure the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Moreouer, being no more participant of the prayers of the Church, or of the prayers of Ieſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.9.</note> who going to his death, declared that he prayed not for the world, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, they were excluded from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſaintes, what hope is there of their ſaluation? I know well enough that the moſt part of them doe ieſt at thoſe things which we ſay, and that they doe not beleeue, either the word of the Apoſtle, or ours: But they ought to note that which S. Paule ſpeaketh:

<note place="margin">Matth. 5.18.</note> Alſo the heauen and earth ſhall periſh: but one iotte of it ſhall not paſſe till all be fulfilled: and to conclude, that which the wiſe man ſayth, that men commonly make great diſcourſes in their mindes: but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they thinke, the counſaile of God getteth the vpper hand, and what imagination ſoeuer we haue to the contrary, he remaineth ſtable, firme, and immoueable. If then the Apoſtates hauing caſt themſelues out of the Church, doe giue no more place or authoritie to the worde of God, or to any admonition which may be made vnto them in his name, it is time loſt to

And what ſhewe or likelihood ſoeuer they make, that they haue a deſire to returne to vs againe, they do it either to deceaue vs, or to content in ſome ſort thoſe of whom they haue yet ſome regard, and not for any good wil they beare vnto it.

For as concerning the power, wrath, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, they can not ſo eſcape, but that they ſhall be purſued inceſſantly.

<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> that is ſtronge and ſtable vnto the ende.

O that their eies were open as the eyes of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha and his ſeruant,

So the Deuils and all the gates of hell, yea and all the creatures which are in heauen and in earth, be enemies vnto thoſe that are enemies vnto God, and to thoſe from whome he hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen his fauor: and there is not one of them which doth not with all her might and maine ſtriue and contend to bring to paſſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: as likewiſe contrarily,

Whereof the Apoſtle in his epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes ſpeaketh more plainely after this ſorte. <hi>Likewiſe then as by the offenſe of one,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.18</note> the fault came on all men to condemnation, ſo by the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of one the benefite abounded toward all men by the iustification of life.</hi> And in the firſt to the Corinthians, <hi>For as by man came death,
<note place="margin">1.

The caſe then ſtanding ſo, that he is the onely meanes whereby men may be bleſſed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Apoſtates haue ſeparated themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues from him, may it not thereof be inferred that they are wretched and miſerable, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their perſons, but alſo in the vſe and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other thinges which are in their power to attaine vnto, though they doe not perceiue or feele it at this preſent; becauſe they are blockiſh and like vnto children, who at the age of two or three yeares loſe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; mothers with the reſt of their friends, who in the abſence of their parentes, might helpe and ſuccour them in their neceſſities: this loſſe is a great miſery vnto them, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe they doe not conceiue.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7280:38"/>ſeaſon doe not perceiue a thouſand thouſand miſeries which they dragge after them in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place whereſoeuer they goe. An old Father had wont to ſay, he was content if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, neuer to be ſicke, but if he were, he deſired to haue a feeling of his ſicknes: and ſurely not without a cauſe: for the ſore which is not felt, is a double ſore: ſo that the miſerie of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates is ſo much the more dangerous, by howe much the leſſe they feele and knowe it. Nowe that we may conclude theſe thinges: namely, that as thoſe who are and doe abide in Ieſus Chriſt, are by his meanes happye in all things: ſo contrariwiſe thoſe that are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, in whome alone conſiſt all the bleſſings: which are in the worlde, can not be but moſt miſerable.

They may well be compared vnto Tantalus who dieth for hunger &amp; thirſt though he hath by him great abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall both to eate &amp; drink: this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being excepted that is betwene him &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the meates do fly Tantalus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would approche vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe flye the meates whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come neare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For they haue (as I may ſay) the Church ſet vp and open at their dores, and yet will not take the paines to
<pb facs="tcp:7280:71"/>take three ſteps to enter into it, to be fed with the celeſtial bread. Which doth ſhew that they doe not muche hunger after it, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that they make themſelues vnworthy of the adminiſtration thereof vnto them. For the benefits of God are onely for thoſe which doe deſire and long after them, &amp; not for the other who doe diſdaine them: as the virgine Marie ſayeth in her ſong:
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.53.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath filled the hungrie with good thinges and ſent away the riche emptie.</hi> To which that agreeth alſo which Ieſus Chriſt ſayd,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.6</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirst for righteouſnes: for they ſhall be filled:</hi> And in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.37.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man thirst, let him come vnto me and drinke. He that beleeueth in me</hi> (as ſayth the Scripture) <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow riuers of water of life.</hi> Which he ſpake of the ſpirit that they ſhould receiue who ſhould beleue in him. And Eſay agreeing vnto this,
<note place="margin">Eſay. 55.1.</note> ſayth: <hi>Ho euerie one that thirsteth come ye to the waters, and ye that haue no ſiluer, come, buy and eate: Come I ſay, buy wine and milke without ſiluer and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mony. Wherfore do ye lay out ſiluer &amp; not eat bread? And your labour without being ſatisfied? Harken diligently vnto me, and eate that which is good and let your ſoule delight in fatnes: Incline your eares, and come vnto me: heare, &amp; your ſoules ſhall liue, and I will make an euerlaſting couenant,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7280:71"/>with you, euen the ſure mercies of Dauid.</hi> By all theſe places of the Scripture) it may appeare that the Goſpell, the grace of God, the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes &amp; all ſpirituall bleſſings, be not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred but onely to thoſe who deſire them: not geuen but to thoſe who ſeeke them, yea and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them it is forbidden:
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.6.</note> 
                  <hi>to geue that which is boly vnto Doggs, or to caſt pearles before ſwine,</hi>

<note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> then all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of the kingdome of heauen, which was gredely longed after by them in old tyme, &amp; as it were ſnatched by thoſe who were more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo great was the preſſe and multitude of thoſe which ſtriued to enter therin firſt, and were not kept back from running and aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues vnto it, with any feare they had of the threatnings of tyraunts, or of the loſſe of their goods, or of moſt cruell torments which they ſawe prepared for them, if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owed the Religion of Ieſus Chriſt. For they counted nothing more deare then the readie ſuffring of Martyredome, to be crowned with glory, which he doth promiſe in heauen to all thoſe which ſhall neither be aſhamed,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.32.</note> nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe his name beneath here in earth But at this preſent men be ſo cowardly and ſo faint hearted, that the moſt part of them draw
<pb facs="tcp:7280:72"/>backe, and looke one vpon another, lingring who ſhalbe the laſt to follow the captaine. And they thinke that their cowardiſe is not ſeene when they do forgo ſome friuolous excuſes to cloke it withall. But before we come to the confutation of their excuſes and to take away the viſarde, wherby they would diſſemble ther hypocriſie, we muſt propound vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome certaine infallible Axiomes it ſhall ſerue for a rule to direct them, &amp; for a light to lighten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultations. The firſt ſhalbe that ther is no ſaluation but in the church. As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth.

                  <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord god of Iſrael, becauſe he hath viſited &amp; redeemed his peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple.</hi> That we may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made partakers of the ſaluation which god the Father doth offer vnto vs in his ſonne, we muſt be vnited vnto him, &amp;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7280:72"/>made members of his body: that is to ſaye that we be adopted into the houſhold of Abraham with whom the couenant hath bene made, and aſſociated by faith with the holy &amp; vniuerſall church, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be done except we beleue the communion of the Sainctes and vntil ſuch time as we be ioyned with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the publicke aſſemblyes, wherein the word of God is preached, the Sacramentes adminiſtred, the order kept in confeſſions, prayers, and open thankes geuinges, and in the diſcipline and cenſures, which are made of maners, to put in authoritie the practiſe and vſe of the worde of God, and to meete with thoſe corruptions which otherwiſe eaſily enter into the Church and alter it. The ſecond Axiome is,
<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> that in thinges: which God doth commaunde we ought not to delaye, nor to be ſlowe to put them in execution. But alwayes to haue our loynes girded vp, and houlde in our handes the burning lampe, to be readye to goe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, whether it ſhal pleaſe him to ſend vs. And to do readily that which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth vs:
<note place="margin">Rom. 1. Heb. 11. Gen. 12.4.</note> For true faith is euer accompanied with this ready obedience, as we ſee by experience in Abraham the Father of the beleeuers; who was ready to departe out of his countrey and leaue all his commodities, yea and to ſacrifice
<pb facs="tcp:7280:73"/>his owne ſonne in whom he put the effect and truethe of the promiſe,
<note place="margin">Gen. 22.3.</note> as ſoone as God had commaunded him. And that is it which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt teacheth vs to aske of his Father, to wit:
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.10.</note> 
                  <hi>that his will ſhould be done in earth as it is in heauen:</hi> That is to ſay that he do graunt vs the grace, that we be as ready and willing to doe his will, as the Angells which are in heauen who haue no ſooner receaued the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God but euen in the verye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt they put it in execution: for God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not thoſe dodgers which bargayne and aske ſtill more dayes of aduiſe to deliberate v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that which he commaundeth them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould do it, or not. For ſithens he is the Soueraigne Lord, &amp; commandeth nothing but that which is reaſonable and for the profit of thoſe whome he will employ in his ſeruice muſt we take counſell: whether we ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him or no in that which he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde vs? and to be more haſtie or ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in accompliſhing his will, then are ſenſeles creatures; which doe not come ſhort, or go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde in anie one litle point of that, which the creatour doth command them.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.5. Exod. 4.14 Ier. 1.7.</note> The Scripture teacheth how God was greeuouſly prouoked againſt Moſes, Ieremy and Ionas, in that they were wayward in taking the charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7280:73"/>which he was to giue them, &amp; in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he commaunded them. And the great daunger wherein Ionas fell becauſe becauſe he would haue fledde away,
<note place="margin">Ion. 1.4.</note> to the end he might haue exempted himſelf from going to Niniuye, whether God would haue ſent him doth ſhew plainly enough, the iminent perill to which they lay open themſelues who delay ſo long to enter into the Church: &amp; to obey in that the calling of god, who doth ſummone &amp; inuite them ſo willingly vnto him,
<note place="margin">Eſay. 65.</note> hauing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day from morning to night his armes ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth to receaue and embrace them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto him.

<note place="margin">Luk. 9.62.</note> firſt to go bid them farewell which were at his houſe: <hi>No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> (ſayeth he to him) <hi>that putteth his hand to the plowe, and looketh backe, is apt for the kingdome of God.</hi> The thirde Axiome, that we ought neuer to let flippe the occaſion of weldoing, nor a receauing the benefite that God doth ſet before vs, when occaſion offreth it ſelfe: but apply our ſelues immediatly vnto it, and vſe it, leſt that it being once loſt, it cannot be poſſiblye recouered againe. That is it which Chriſt Ieſus ſayde ſpeaking vnto the Iewes,
<pb facs="tcp:7280:74"/>
                  <hi>Yet a litle while is the light with you,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 12, 35.</note> walke while ye haue light, leaſt the darkneſſe come vpon you: for he that walketh in the darke knoweth not whether he goeth,</hi> admoniſhing them thereby, that they ſhould take heede of reiecting of the grace which God offred vnto them in him, &amp; by him, &amp; that if they did, it being taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they could no more come by it, which they haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in deed; for hauing not receiued the light then when it was offred, they haue bene vtterly depriued therof, and are yet at this day. So that ſince fifteene hundred yeares ago, there hath not beene in the whole world, a people more wretched than that; becauſe they haue not knowne the time of their viſitation,
<note place="margin">Luk. 19, 44</note> and haue not receyued the great benefites which God would haue beſtowed on them, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were offered; thoſe that were bidden to the wedding of the kings ſon did excuſe them ſelues,
<note place="margin">Matt. 22, 5.</note> the one alledging their merchandize, the other their domeſticall buſines, and the reſt thoſe impediments which they had: they were ſo farre from ſatiſfiyng and contenting the king by theſe excuſes, that contrariwiſe his anger beeing more extremely kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that had not made any account of the honor &amp; fauour that he did vnto them, he pronounced them vnworthy of his liberalitie,

<note place="margin">Mat. 25.10</note> The fooliſh virgines, becauſe they had not the care to light their lamps in due time, were ouertaken by the comminge of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, and excluded out of the hall where the banket was made, which dothe teache vs not to imitate the ſlouthefull, who gaſpe and wringe their handes, or hange downe their armes then, when they ſhoulde worke in the time of neede.

<pb facs="tcp:7280:75"/>to receiue his graces; whenſoeuer he is willing to impart them vnto vs. The fourth Axiome is, that it is a moſt dangerous thing to tempt long the patience of God. Whereof there is ſuch a notable place in S. Paule:
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thou the riches of his bountifulnes and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and long, ſufferance, not knowing that the bountifulnes of God leadeth thee to repentance? but thou, after thine hurdnes, and hart that can not repent, heapast vnto thy ſelfe wrath, against the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the iust iudgement of God, who will reward euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes: that is, to them which by continuance in well doing, ſeeke glory, and honour, and immortalitie, eternall life: but vnto them that are contentious, &amp; diſobey the truth, and obey vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes, ſhall be indignation and wrath.</hi> For my part, I do maruell that ſuch threatnings do not moue otherwiſe theſe delayers, which doe abuſe ſo long the patience &amp; goodnes of God, which we can not contemne, without thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting our ſelues into an open danger of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of God and his grace from vs for euer, and to depriue our ſelues conſequently of all the hope that we can haue of eternall life, and of the reſt which God hath promiſed to his choſen.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.7.</note> As the Prophet ſayth: <hi>To day, if ye ſhall heare his voice, harden not, your harts, as in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribah,

The firſt is, that they doubt of the threatnings of God, and that which cauſeth them to doubt is,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.6</note> that he is ſlowe vnto anger, and to execute his iudgements. For he is inclined of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnto mercye and meekenes,
<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.23. &amp; 32.</note> and deſireth not the deathe of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhoulde repent and liue. It is a griefe to him, and agaynſt his will, that he ſtretcheth out his
<pb facs="tcp:7280:76"/>hand to ſtrike vs: and when he doth it, being conſtrained by our malice and obſtinacie, he doth it againſt his owne nature, and doth as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay ſayth,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 28.21.</note> a ſtrange worke. <hi>The Lorde ſhall ſtande as in mount Perazim, he ſhall be wrath as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his worke, his ſtraunge worke, and bring to paſſe his acte, his ſtrange acte.</hi> Neuertheles, being iuſt as he is, to ſatisfice his iuſtice after he hath long ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he ſhould ſee that we ſhould perſeuere in our iniquities, and that we ſhould make no accompt of leauing our euill wayes, to returne to him, then to his great griefe he beginneth to ſhewe his wrath, and execute his iudgements vpon vs: proteſting in the meane time, that it did not lye in him,
<note place="margin">Oſea 13.</note> that we are not ſaued, and that our ruine and deſtruction commeth from none other, but from our ſelues. So though God ſuffereth our ſinne to ſleepe for a ſeaſon, and goeth not about to puniſhe it as ſoone as it is committed: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he forgetteth nothing of his iuſtice, but calleth at the verie inſtant, wherein he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his aſſiſes all his debtors, and emiſeth them to paye vnto him his due, and all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues alreadye paſt. We muſt then holde this for certayne, that God is true in all his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that his truth being eſſentiall and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7280:76"/>coeternal with him, he can not chooſe but put it in execution,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. Iames. 1.</note> and as well his threatnings as his promiſes, in the time which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: becauſe in him there is not yea and nay, nor any mutation or ſhadowe of change. The other thing which doth abuſe the delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is the opinion which they haue, that the iudgement of God is euer farther of from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then it is: and that ſeeing it approch they may eaſily eſcape it. That is it which deceiued thoſe who liued in the time of the floode, and the Sodomites, and Pharaoh, and Achab, and Balthaſar, and the inhabitantes of Ieruſalem when it was deſtroyed by Nabuchadnezar, and ſince by the Romanes. For although the iudgementes of God were euen at their dores, and that they were often forewarned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Prophetes and ſeruauntes of God; neuertheleſſe they neuer beleeued any thing, vntill that they were taken at vnwares, and that drinking, eating, laughing, ſporting;
<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> and euen then when they thought themſelues to bee moſte ſure, they were all at once ouerthrowne. For,
<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.2</note> 
                  <hi>The daye of the Lorde commeth as a theefe in the night,</hi> Who doth watche a fitte houre to ſlippe himſelfe eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye into the houſe whiche hee intendeth to robbe, that he be not diſcouered. And as
<pb facs="tcp:7280:77"/>the lightning, which is no ſooner ſeene but it vaniſheth away: therefore they that delay to performe their dutie and do take their pleaſure for the hope they haue that God is not readie to call them to his audit to make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countes, are oftentimes deceiued, as well as the naughtie ſeruaunt who ſayd in his hearte, my maiſter doth deferre his comming, let me cate, and drinke and be merrie: and in the meane time his maiſter commeth in a daye when he looketh not for him,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.50</note> and in an houre, that he is not aware of, and doeth cut him of, and giue him his portion with the hypocrites, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. The thirde thing which deceiueth theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, is the vaine hope which they haue, that they ſhall euer haue ſome meanes or other to agree with God before they die.
<note place="margin">Prou. 3.7.</note> But it were better for them not to be wiſe in their owne eyes: but to feare the Lorde and to departe from euill. And heare what the wiſedome of God ſayth by Salomon,

                  <hi>Becauſe I haue called and ye refuſed: I haue ſtretched out my hande, and none woulde regarde: but ye haue despiſed all my counſell, and woulde none of my correction.

They woulde none of my counſell, but despiſed all my correction, therefore ſhall they eate of the fruite of their owne way, and be filled with their owne deuiſes, for eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſhe, and the prosperitie of fooles deſtroyeth them. But he that obeyeth me, ſhall dwell ſafely, and be quiet from feare of euill.</hi> It is recorded of Fabius Maximus, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing the time he ſtayed and aſwaged by litle and litle the fierceneſſe of Hanniball, and by delay he deliuered the common wealth of Rome, from the greateſt perill that euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell vnto it: by reaſon whereof the wiſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings vſe of tentimes diſſimulation and leaſure in their affaires, and condemne ſwiftneſſe and ſpeedineſſe for great raſhneſſe: and in trueth, for thoſe who haue to doe amongeſt men it is requiſite to haue a ſtayed, and well ſettled wit that doeth not haſten too muche: but ponder and weigh wiſely all counſels, and all reaſons before it conclude what to do. For as the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſay, the latter thoughtes are commonly the wiſeſt and beſt, but towardes God there is nothing more dangerous then to delay, nor

To aunſwer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to all that which they obiect, I ſaye firſt, that the true countrey of a Chriſtian man (as ſaith S.

And I ſay furthermore that it is the beſt, happieſt and moſt delightfull and pleaſanteſt ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that is in all the world. For it is the gard on which God hath plated, which he himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:7280:96"/>hath tilled, and wherein he taketh all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; where the trees of righteouſnes, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed plantes of the houſe of God, the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, and the tree of lyfe, which is alwayes greene are to be found. beſides there are the cleere riuers and ſpringes, of the water,

For it is the ſchoole and only place, where it is poſſible for anye man to learne to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie; and if they refuſed to followe thee being not drawne of the Father, without whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour none can come to Ieſus Chriſt: thou art yet at the leaſt diſcharged of thy dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them, and towardes God. But what if a woman be ſo willfull, that ſhe will tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her husband without ceaſing, if he doe not conſent vnto her to commit idolatrye, and goe to the Maſſe with her: ought he not in this to obeye her, to liue with her in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, and to continue peace in his houſe? To aunſwere to this queſtion, when that chanceth, it is a great temptation for the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, who ought then to praye vnto God earneſtly, that he woulde ſtrengthen him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide conſtantly in the obedience of his holye will, without declining from the ſame in any ſorte.

So farre was it in thoſe times from the husbands to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to beleeue their wiues, &amp; to obey them, &amp; worſhip ſtrange Gods with them. Let them then alledge no more ſuch excuſes to cloke their diſloyalty. There are ſome alſo, who when they are vrged to enter into the Congregation of the Church, that alledge for their excuſe, that it is good to waite vntill all things be at a better ſtaye, and more at quiet: but they ſtaye, for that they will not be of a long tyme ready:

<pb facs="tcp:7280:104"/>thinke that beinge out of the bodye of the Church their praiers and other exerciſes can be acceptable vnto God: for if the father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth no oblation but that which is offered vpon the altar, that is to ſay which is preſented vnto him by the ſonne, howe can they aſſure themſelues that their praiers are heard &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, ſeeing they are not members of the bodye of Ieſus Chriſt?

Thereof it inſueth that they are not numbred among his ſheepe, and conſequently that they and all that proceedeth from them is abhominable before God. Therfore he ſaith, ſpeaking of ſuch perſons who being ſeparated from the Church content themſelues to make their praiers priuately.

And then will I profeſſe to them I neuer knew you: depart from me

<note place="margin">Rom. 10. Matth. 10. Matth. 5.</note> for our light ought not to lye vnder the buſhell but to be <hi>Set on high vpon a candleſticke to lighten all thoſe that come into the houſe</hi> We ought to beare the badge of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt in our foreheades,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 7.</note> which is the place moſt eminent and apparant in all our bodie, we ought not to hide our ſcarfes, nor to turne our coates, nor feare to be knowne by our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery to the ſouldiers of Ieſus Chriſt. He hath died for vs, not ſecretly, in an vnknowne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or cloſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knowledge of the world: but in the open place of the ſculles, where they had wont to execute the guiltie and euil doers,

He is not aſhamed euen nowe that he is in his glory to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and auouch vs for his brethren, and ſhall we be aſhamed to confeſſe him to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? God by his grace and perfect goodnes, grant to the delayers, to know and vnderſtand betime the great fault which they commit, by diſſembling ſo long: that they may by a true repentance ſpeedily preuent the fearefull iudgement of God which hangeth ouer their heads if they haſten not.
